File System
===========

The Files API is universal for both modes and provides all the necessary methods for working with the Nextcloud file system.
Refer to the `Files examples <https://github.com/cloud-py-api/nc_py_api/tree/main/examples/as_client/files>`_ to see how to use them nicely.

All File APIs are designed to work relative to the current user.
