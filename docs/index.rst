NC_Py_API documentation
=======================

| *A framework, library, or your best Python tool to work with Nextcloud.*
| It supports two modes: as a client library or as a framework for developing next-generation applications.

The key features are:
    * **Fast**: High performance, and as low-latency as possible.
    * **Intuitive**: Fast to code, easy to use.
    * **Reliable**: Minimum number of incompatible changes.
    * **Robust**: All code is covered with tests as much as possible.
    * **Easy**: Designed to be easy to use with excellent documentation.

Overview
========

The main goal of this project is to provide a fast and easy way to develop and deploy Python applications for Nextcloud.
The option to use it as a client library is a beneficial side effect.
The code is unified, and the codebase for both modes is the same. Tests are carried out for both modes.

If you have any questions or corrections regarding the documentation,
we would be glad to address them in discussions, incorporate corrections through pull requests,
and handle complex problems through issues.

Have a great time with Python and Nextcloud!
